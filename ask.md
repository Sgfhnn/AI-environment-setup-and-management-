You are an AI developer assistant. I already have a working Python GUI tool called "AI Setup & Management Tool" (main.py) for Windows that scans and installs Flutter development components. 

Prepare the code so it can be **packaged as a single Windows .exe** using PyInstaller. Ensure the following:
- The tool retains all its current functionalities.
- GUI works correctly.
- Admin permission requests (UAC) work for installations.
- The code is modular, clean, and ready for packaging.

Do not remove or alter any existing functionalities. Focus on making the tool ready for **Windows .exe distribution**.

after you did that Help me clean up my Git commit history. I want to drop all commits except the last one from the history while keeping the code exactly as it is right now. Use interactive rebase or the safest Git approach. After cleanup, my local branch should match my current working code but without the unwanted commits in the history. Also, force push to origin so GitHub reflects the new history.
